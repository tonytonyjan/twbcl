      caption: "The Building Component Library is a repository of building data used to create building energy models. The data are broken down into separate components that represent parts of a building: windows, walls, schedules, and weather information are a few examples."
      caption2: "Search for components by type or keyword and use the facets to narrow down your search. Once you find the components you need, download them and insert them in your energy model."
      caption3: "The components are designed to provide data to the energy modeler and simplify the process of gathering inputs. The range of components goes from whole buildings to detailed files, like duct sealing components."
